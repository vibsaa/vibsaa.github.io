Projects
--------
**[*Condition Monitoring of Industrial & Commercial Refrigeration Systems using IoT*](https://prezi.com/view/4bmIZZe6mSGPyPI7kJwv/)** (Feb 21 - May 21)

- ESP-32 and Embedded C is used for implementing the Hardware-Software
Education.
- Design and Development of a real-time monitoring system based on the 4-layer architecture of IoT, which will help in condition monitoring of these refrigerators and support the facilitation of condition-based maintenance.

**[*Support systems for visually impaired*](https://github.com/vibsaa/vibsaa.github.io/blob/b99437c01090826877c5a50e624f96b329303d39/Images&Credentials/NCERT_Certi.jpeg)** (Jan 21- Mar 21)

- ESP-32 and Embedded C is used for implementing the Hardware-Software.
- Various systems are developed by a group of students to make it possible for visually impaired people to perform elementary science experiments like speed calculation, optics experiments, knowledge of flower parts, etc.
- All the projects are developed for & with NCERT under the title "Development of Tactile Kit manual in science at upper primary stage"

**[*Memory blocks & FSM design using RTL*](https://github.com/vibsaa/OpenSource_verilog)** (Nov 20- Nov 20)
- Spartan-6 FPGA and Verilog is used for implementing the Hardware-Software.
- 1KB RAM block with asynchronous Read/Write and a Register Bank with 8, 16 Bits registers are designed and implemented.
- Xilinx ISE & open-source tools like iVerilog and GTKwave are used for developing the systems.

**[*Double Dice Game*](https://github.com/vibsaa/OpenSource_verilog)** (Jan 20- Jan 20)
- Spartan-6 FPGA and Verilog is used for implementing the Hardware-Software.
- The system is equipped with 7-segment displays and Buttons to provides an interactive interface for the user to roll the dice and see the outcome.
- Xilinx ISE & open-source tools like iVerilog and GTKwave are used for designing the system.

**_Two terminal device characterization system_** [v1](https://github.com/vibsaa/pearning) & [v2](https://github.com/vibsaa/CURVE_TRACER_V2) (Sep 19- Dec 19)
- AVR Atmega16 microcontroller & Embedded C (AVR Studio) for v1 and ESP-32 & Embedded C (Arduino IDE) for v2 are used for implementing the Hardware-Software.
- v1 is capable ofis capable of providing the Input-Output characteristics for any two-terminal device under 5 seconds diode and resistance under 5 seconds whereas v2 comes with added functionality of providing the Input-Output characteristics for any two-terminal device (e.g. diode, resistance, capacitor, inductor, etc.) under 5 seconds. 
- The project comes with a GUI created using Python-Tkinter and the obtained characteristics are displayed on a computer screen. NumPy, Matplotlib, and File Handling is used for data manipulation and visualization.
- Eagle CAD is used for designing the schematic and PCB for the system.
